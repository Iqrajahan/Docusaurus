# Introduction
Project is aiming at analysing Credit card customer data to
predict weather a customer will default or not.
Firstly, we performed Exploratory data anlysis on the dataset.
Dataset under observation was imbalanced, to deal with which we used 
class weight to balance the dataset.
After scaling our dataset is now prepared.
We started with a baseline model Linear regression and
performed classification task. Then we tried few other 
classifier to get an optimal solution.
